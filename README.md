# AutomatedGradesChecker
A program that will automatically check aeries for you and notify you when your grades are changed. Made as part of a group project for IB Computer Science SL.
This application requires installation of Python and requests on Python. 
Eclipse is required to run the "Main" method, as creating the jar file proved to be a difficult task for us.
